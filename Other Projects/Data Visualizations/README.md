# Analyzing Bike Sales
## Project Goal
To analyze bike sales data for countries across the world and provide meaningful suggestions. To accomplish this my group and I did an exploratory data analysis noticing that discounts were applied to all products. From there we found that, as expected, discounts drove sales. We noticed discounts were being applied during busy times of the year and suggested profit margins may be higher if sales were used to prop up slow times of the year instead.
## Dataset
[Bike Sales in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/sadiqshah/bike-sales-in-europe) was the dataset we chose. Discounts were calculated since profit plus cost was lower than revenue. Some minor cleaning was required with regards to regions in France to match Tableau formatting.
## Storyboard
Please note I've screen captured the storyboard as I won't be able to host the storyboard on the Tableau website indefinitely.
