# Michael Willis - Data Science Projects Portfolio
Hello!

My name is Michael Willis but you can call me Mike. I have an undergraduate degree in Biological Science (Honours) from the University of Guelph and I have always been interested in computers, programming, and technology in general. Several months before the pandemic hit, the company I worked for implemented a database system to streamline operations. This got me thinking about all that was possible with software development and during the pandemic I began exploring programming and data analysis more in-depth. This reignited my passion and led to me applying for the [Applied A.I. Development Solutions](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-postgraduate-t431) postgraduate program at George Brown College. I started the program in September 2021 and began my journey to becoming a Full Stack Data Scientist. My goal is to develop my software and visualisations skills and combine them with the experience I have working with clients and stakeholders. This will allow me to provide more value to everyone that I work with.

NOTE: This portfolio is actively being updated whenever I have free time! Please check back regularly to see new projects and improvements.
