## Introduction
With the COVID-19 pandemic running rampart, healthcare has taken the forefront globally. Healthcare systems are comprised of many parts, including hospitals, and being able to accurately and efficiently allocate resources to all the systems would increase the quality of treatment available to all patients. When attending a hospital for treatment, a key metric is a patient’s length of stay. The length of stay affects things such as disease transmissibility, how many beds are available, how many nurses, doctors, and staff are needed and when, and which wards are at what capacity. This report’s focus is on: Can patient length of stay in a healthcare system be reliably predicted using a machine learning model based on hospital admission data?
