# Movie Recommender
## Overview
Create a movie recommender based on movie ratings, tags, and genres. This movie recommender includes several filters such as: popularity based filtering, content based filtering, collaborate filtering, and hybrid based filtering.
## Process
1) Read data into dataframes
2) Slice data to 1 million rows to avoid RAM problems
3) Preprocess data by creating a pivot table for user ratings, cleaning genres and tags and dropping unnecessary columns
4) Create desirable filters
5) Average content and collaborate filters to create a hybrid filter
